# User CRUD Application

This project is a full-stack application with a **PHP-based backend** and a **React-based frontend** for managing users. The backend provides a RESTful API to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users, while the frontend allows users to interact with the API to view, add, update, and delete users.
