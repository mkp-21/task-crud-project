# User CRUD Application

This project is a full-stack application with a **PHP-based backend** and a **React-based frontend** for managing users. The backend provides a RESTful API to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users, while the frontend allows users to interact with the API to view, add, update, and delete users.

---

## **Backend - PHP API**

### **Project Description**
The backend of this project provides a RESTful API built with PHP that allows for CRUD operations on user data. The user entity includes **name**, **email**, **password**, and **date of birth (dob)** fields. The backend interacts with a MySQL database to perform these operations.

### **Database Setup**

The backend uses a MySQL database named `user_crud`.

#### Steps to Set Up the Database:

1. **Create the database**: Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin) and create a database named `user_crud`.

2. **Import the SQL file**:

   Navigate to the `sql` directory in the project and import the `user_crud.sql` file into your MySQL database. This file contains the SQL schema to create the `users` table.

  ### Step 1: Clone the repository

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkp-21/task-crud-project.git
### Step 2: Install dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to the React frontend directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
cd task-crud-project/user-crud   # Navigate to the React frontend directory
npm install                      # Install the required Node.js dependencies
### Step 3: Start the React development server

After installing the dependencies, you can start the React frontend application by running:

```bash
npm start  # This will start the React development server
